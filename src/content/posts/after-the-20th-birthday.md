We gathered in Vondelpark, Amsterdam, for Django’s 20th birthday, which also happened to coincide with the very first DjangoNL meetup.

There were around 15 of us and the biggest surprise was seeing [Adrian Holovaty](https://www.holovaty.com/) join — one of the two people who created Django 20 years ago.

We introduced ourselves, shared some Django stories and then played a round of [lightning questions](/pdfs/20th-birthday-lightning-questions.pdf) with asks like “What’s your favorite third-party Django package?”, “Have you ever left the Django debug toolbar running on a live site?” and “If you could meet Django’s creators, what’s the first question you’d ask them?”. With Adrian there, last question wasn’t just hypothetical.

And yes, we ended with cake. 🎂
